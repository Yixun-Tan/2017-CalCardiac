    "Note from Jacob Abba defining data format for CSV Patient ECG Files:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The csv is a sample of the format that I’ll be providing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each CSV file will represent a single admission in a bed, \n",
    "and its filename is an encrypted version of that admission’s ID in our database.\n",
    " \n",
    "Each row in the CSV represents a PVC-type alarm from that admission. \n",
    "The first column is an encrypted version of the alarm’s ID in our database. \n",
    "The second column is the time that the alarm occurred (in number of seconds since the start of the admission). \n",
    "The third column is the strip data for that alarm, which has been deflated and base64 encoded. \n",
    "Note that the rows in these files aren’t sorted in any particular order.\n",
    " \n",
    "To get the strip data, simply use a library in your language of choice to read the base64 string to a buffer, \n",
    "deflate the buffer, and then encode the buffer into a string. In nodejs it looks something like this:\n",
    " \n",
    "let zlib = require(‘zlib’);\n",
    " \n",
    "let s = strip; //load strip\n",
    "let buf = Buffer.from(s, 'base64'); //read strip into buffer\n",
    "let json = zlib.unzipSync(buf).toString(); //deflate buffer and convert to a string\n",
    " \n",
    "Once decoded, the strip is an array in JSON format and looks something like this (without the pretty print):\n",
    " \n",
    "[\n",
    "    {\"Label\":\"I\",\"ID\":\"7\",\"Text\":\"-263,-211,-146,-108,-68,-35,3,…”},\n",
    "    {\"Label\":\"II\",\"ID\":\"8\",\"Text\":\"-312,-272,-220,-177,-137,-111,…”},\n",
    "    …\n",
    "]\n",
    " \n",
    "Pretty self-descriptive; each object within the array represents a channel where \n",
    "the “Label” field contains the label, \n",
    "the “Text” field contains the waveform (with each sample separated by a comma). \n",
    "You can probably ignore the “ID” field, it’s just used internally by bedmaster.\n",
    " \n",
    "A few notes on these strips:\n",
    "1)      In our meeting Xiao and Ran said that they contain data 5 seconds before and 5 seconds after an alarm. \n",
    "As far as I can tell this is not correct; they seem to only contain data 10 seconds before the alarm. \n",
    "For your purposes this shouldn’t matter, but it’s good to know.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)      Sampling frequency of the channels is always 240hz.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)      Some files may contain different numbers of channels. \n",
    "Originally we were planning on only using files that had the \n",
    "8 channels (‘I’, ‘II’, ‘III’, ‘V’, ‘AVR’, ‘AVL’, ‘AVF’, and ‘SPO2’), \n",
    "and discarding other channels. But Ran and Xiao would be able to guide you better on how to handle this.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "For the rules to automatically sort pvc alarms into true- and false-positive categories, \n",
    "you’ll also need timing of artifact alarms for each admission. \n",
    "I’ll work on a script to generate these as well, but it should be simpler since they don’t need to include strips. \n",
    "My plan is to just have text files for each admission (same name as the csv) \n",
    "with each line representing the relative timing of that alarm.\n",
    " \n",
    "You can see Xiao’s earlier email with documentation on the adibin file format.\n",
    " \n",
    "Hopefully this info is helpful to you, \n",
    "if anything is unclear or you need guidance on data conversion/reading the csv then \n",
    "feel free to reach out via text or email!\n",
