abstract = {The occurrence of ventricular premature depolarizations in survivors of myocardial infarction is a risk factor for subsequent sudden death, but whether antiarrhythmic therapy reduces the risk is not known. The Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) is evaluating the effect of antiarrhythmic therapy (encainide, flecainide, or moricizine) in patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic ventricular arrhythmia (six or more ventricular premature beats per hour) after myocardial infarction. As of March 30, 1989, 2309 patients had been recruited for the initial drug-titration phase of the study: 1727 (75 percent) had initial suppression of their arrhythmia (as assessed by Holter recording) through the use of one of the three study drugs and had been randomly assigned to receive active drug or placebo. During an average of 10 months of follow-up, the patients treated with active drug had a higher rate of death from arrhythmia than the patients assigned to placebo. Encainide and flecainide accounted for the excess of deaths from arrhythmia and nonfatal cardiac arrests (33 of 730 patients taking encainide or flecainide [4.5 percent]; 9 of 725 taking placebo [1.2 percent]; relative risk, 3.6; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.7 to 8.5). They also accounted for the higher total mortality (56 of 730 [7.7 percent] and 22 of 725 [3.0 percent], respectively; relative risk, 2.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 4.5). Because of these results, the part of the trial involving encainide and flecainide has been discontinued. We conclude that neither encainide nor flecainide should be used in the treatment of patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic ventricular arrhythmia after myocardial infarction, even though these drugs may be effective initially in suppressing ventricular arrhythmia. Whether these results apply to other patients who might be candidates for antiarrhythmic therapy is unknown.},

It begins with an historical account of the many innovations and innovators on whose work the field rests. This is accompanied by a discussion of both the theories and experiments which werecontributed to the development of the field. The physiological origin of bioelectric and biomagnetic signal is discussed in detail. The sensitivity in a given measurement situation, the energy distribution in stimulation with the same electrodes, and the measurement of impedance are related anddescribed by the electrode lead field. It is shown that, based on the reciprocity theorem, these are identical and further, that these procedures apply equally well for biomagnetic considerations. The difference between corresponding bioelectric and biomagnetic methods is discussed. The book shows,that all subfields of bioelectromagnetism obey the same basic laws and they are closely tied together through the principle of reciprocity. Thus the book helps the reader to understand the properties of existing bioelectric and biomagnetic measurements and stimulation methods and to design newsystems. The book includes about 300 carefully drawn illustrations and 500 references. It can be used as a textbook for third or fourth year university students and as a source of reference.},

abstract = {IEEE Objective: We developed an image-based electrocardiographic (ECG) quality assessment technique that mimics how clinicians annotate ECG signal quality. Methods: We adopted the Structural Similarity Measure (SSIM) to compare images of two ECG records that are obtained from displaying ECGs in a standard scale. Then a subset of representative ECG images from the training set was selected as templates through a clustering method. SSIM between each image and all the templates were used as the feature vector for the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier. We also employed three commonly used ECG signal quality index (SQI) measures: baseSQI, kSQI, and sSQI to compare with the proposed image quality index (IQI) approach. We used 1926 annotated ECG, recorded from patient monitors, and associated with six different ECG arrhythmia alarm types which were obtained previously from an ECG Alarm Study at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). In addition, we applied the templates from the UCSF database to test the SSIM approach on the publicly available PhysioNet Challenge 2011 data. Results: For the UCSF database, the proposed IQI algorithm achieved an accuracy of 93.1{\%} and outperformed all the SQI metrics, baseSQI, kSQI, and sSQI, with accuracies of 85.7{\%}, 63.7{\%}, and 73.8{\%} respectively. Moreover, evaluation of our algorithm on the PhysioNet data showed an accuracy of 82.5{\%}. Conclusion: The proposed algorithm showed better performance for assessing ECG signal quality than traditional signal processing methods. Significance: A more accurate assessment of ECG signal quality can lead to a more robust ECG-based diagnosis of cardiovascular conditions.},

It has lived a far longer life than any of its creators ever expected. Together with the American Heart Association Database, it played an interesting role in stimulating manufacturers of arrhythmia analyzers to compete on the basis of objectively measurable performance, and much of the current appreciation of the value of common databases, both for basic research and for medical device development and evaluation, can be attributed to this experience.

abstract = {PURPOSE: Physiologic monitors are plagued with alarms that create a cacophony of sounds and visual alerts causing "alarm fatigue" which creates an unsafe patient environment because a life-threatening event may be missed in this milieu of sensory overload. Using a state-of-the-art technology acquisition infrastructure, all monitor data including 7 ECG leads, all pressure, SpO(2), and respiration waveforms as well as user settings and alarms were stored on 461 adults treated in intensive care units. Using a well-defined alarm annotation protocol, nurse scientists with 95{\%} inter-rater reliability annotated 12,671 arrhythmia alarms.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A total of 2,558,760 unique alarms occurred in the 31-day study period: arrhythmia, 1,154,201; parameter, 612,927; technical, 791,632. There were 381,560 audible alarms for an audible alarm burden of 187/bed/day. 88.8{\%} of the 12,671 annotated arrhythmia alarms were false positives. Conditions causing excessive alarms included inappropriate alarm settings, persistent atrial fibrillation, and non-actionable events such as PVC's and brief spikes in ST segments. Low amplitude QRS complexes in some, but not all available ECG leads caused undercounting and false arrhythmia alarms. Wide QRS complexes due to bundle branch block or ventricular pacemaker rhythm caused false alarms. 93{\%} of the 168 true ventricular tachycardia alarms were not sustained long enough to warrant treatment.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDISCUSSION: The excessive number of physiologic monitor alarms is a complex interplay of inappropriate user settings, patient conditions, and algorithm deficiencies. Device solutions should focus on use of all available ECG leads to identify non-artifact leads and leads with adequate QRS amplitude. Devices should provide prompts to aide in more appropriate tailoring of alarm settings to individual patients. Atrial fibrillation alarms should be limited to new onset and termination of the arrhythmia and delays for ST-segment and other parameter alarms should be configurable. Because computer devices are more reliable than humans, an opportunity exists to improve physiologic monitoring and reduce alarm fatigue.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Alarm fatigue is a widely recognized safety and quality problem where exposure to high rates of clinical alarms results in desensitization leading to dismissal of or slowed response to alarms. Nonactionable alarms are thought to be especially problematic. Despite these concerns, the number of clinical alarm signals has been increasing as an everincreasing number of medical technologies are added to the clinical care environment. DATA SOURCES PubMed, SCOPUS, Embase, and CINAHL. STUDY SELECTION We performed a systematic review of the literature focused on clinical alarms. We asked a primary key question; "what interventions have been attempted and resulted in the success of reducing alarm fatigue?" and 3-secondary key questions; "what are the negative effects on patients/families; what are the balancing outcomes (unintended consequences of interventions); and what human factor approaches apply to making an effective alarm?" DATA EXTRACTION Articles relevant to the Key Questions were selected through an iterative review process and relevant data was extracted using a standardized tool. DATA SYNTHESIS We found 62 articles that had relevant and usable data for at least one key question. We found that no study used/developed a clear definition of "alarm fatigue." For our primary key question 1, the relevant studies focused on three main areas: quality improvement/bundled activities; intervention comparisons; and analysis of algorithm-based false and total alarm suppression. All sought to reduce the number of total alarms and/or false alarms to improve the positive predictive value. Most studies were successful to varying degrees. None measured alarm fatigue directly. CONCLUSIONS There is no agreed upon valid metric(s) for alarm fatigue, and the current methods are mostly indirect. Assuming that reducing the number of alarms and/or improving positive predictive value can reduce alarm fatigue, there are promising avenues to address patient safety and quality problem. Further investment is warranted not only in interventions that may reduce alarm fatigue but also in defining how to best measure it.},

In our previous work, an attempt to alleviate this problem by finding combinations of monitor alarms and laboratory test that were predictive of code blue events, called SuperAlarms. Our current work consists of developing a novel time series representation that accounts for both cumulative effects and temporality was developed, and it is applied to code blue prediction in the intensive care unit (ICU). The health status of patients is represented both by a term frequency approach, TF, often used in natural language processing; and by our novel cumulative approach. We call this representation "weighted accumulated occurrence representation", or WAOR. These two representations are fed into a L1 regularized logistic regression classifier, and are used to predict code blue events. Our performance was assessed online in an independent set. We report the sensitivity of our algorithm at different time windows prior to the code blue event, as well as the work-up to detect ratio and the proportion of false code blue detections divided by the number of false monitor alarms. We obtained a better performance with our cumulative representation, retaining a sensitivity close to our previous work while improving the other metrics.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 1964-2012 IEEE. Objective: Our previous studies have shown that 'code blue' events can be predicted by SuperAlarm patterns that are multivariate combinations of monitor alarms and laboratory test results cooccurring frequently preceding the events but rarely among control patients. Deploying these patterns to the monitor data streams can generate SuperAlarm sequences. The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that SuperAlarm sequences may contain more predictive sequential patterns than monitor alarms sequences. Methods: Monitor alarms and laboratory test results are extracted from a total of 254 adult coded and 2213 control patients. The training dataset is composed of subsequences that are sampled from complete sequences and then further represented as fixed-dimensional vectors by the term frequency inverse document frequency method. The information gain technique and weighted support vector machine are adopted to select the most relevant features and train a classifier to differentiate sequences between coded patients and control patients. Performances are assessed based on an independent dataset using three metrics: sensitivity of lead time (Sen L @T), alarm frequency reduction rate (AFRR), and work-up to detection ratio (WDR). Results: The performance of 12-h-long sequences of SuperAlarm can yield a Sen L @2 of 93.33{\%}, an AFRR of 87.28{\%}, and a WDR of 3.01. At an AFRR = 87.28{\%}, Sen L @2 for raw alarm sequences and discretized alarm sequences are 73.33{\%} and 70.19{\%}, respectively. At a WDR = 3.01, Sen L @2 are 49.88{\%} and 43.33{\%}. Conclusion and Significance: The results demonstrate that SuperAlarm sequences indeed outperform monitor alarm sequences and suggest that one can focus on sequential patterns from SuperAlarm sequences to develop more precise patient monitoring solutions.},

abstract = {Bedside monitors are ubiquitous in acute care units of modern healthcare enterprises. However, they have been criticized for generating an excessive number of false positive alarms causing alarm fatigue among care givers and potentially compromising patient safety. We hypothesize that combinations of regular monitor alarms denoted as SuperAlarm set may be more indicative of ongoing patient deteriorations and hence predictive of in-hospital code blue events. The present work develops and assesses an alarm mining approach based on finding frequent combinations of single alarms that are also specific to code blue events to compose a SuperAlarm set. We use 4-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to investigate the influence of four algorithm parameters on the performance of the data mining approach. The results are obtained from millions of monitor alarms from a cohort of 223 adult code blue and 1768 control patients using a multiple 10-fold cross-validation experiment setup. Using the optimal setting of parameters determined in the cross-validation experiment, final SuperAlarm sets are mined from the training data and used on an independent test data set to simulate running a SuperAlarm set against live regular monitor alarms. The ANOVA shows that the content of a SuperAlarm set is influenced by a subset of key algorithm parameters. Simulation of the extracted SuperAlarm set shows that it can predict code blue events one hour ahead with sensitivity between 66.7{\%} and 90.9{\%} while producing false SuperAlarms for control patients that account for between 2.2{\%} and 11.2{\%} of regular monitor alarms depending on user-supplied acceptable false positive rate. We conclude that even though the present work is still preliminary due to the usage of a moderately-sized database to test our hypothesis it represents an effort to develop algorithms to alleviate the alarm fatigue issue in a unique way. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc..},

In our work, we developed a robust methodology that, without the need for additional non-ECG waveforms, suppresses false positive ventricular tachycardia (VT) alarms without resulting in false negative alarms. Our approach is based on features extracted from the ECG signal 20 seconds prior to a triggered alarm. We applied a multi resolution wavelet transform to the ECG data 20 seconds prior to the alarm trigger, extracted features from appropriately chosen scales and combined them across all available leads. These representations are presented to a L1-regularized logistic regression classifier. Results are shown in two datasets of physiological waveforms with manually assessed cardiac monitor alarms: the MIMIC II dataset, where we achieved a false alarm (FA) suppression of 21{\%} with zero true alarm (TA) suppression; and a dataset compiled by UCSF and General Electric, where a 36{\%} FA suppression was achieved with a zero TA suppression.

abstract = {Cardiac arrest can strike a seemingly healthy individual of any age, race, ethnicity, or gender at any time in any location, often without warning. Cardiac arrest is the third leading cause of death in the United States, following cancer and heart disease. Four out of five cardiac arrests occur in the home, and more than 90 percent of individuals with cardiac arrest die before reaching the hospital. First and foremost, cardiac arrest treatment is a community issue-local resources and personnel must provide appropriate, high-quality care to save the life of a community member. Time between onset of arrest and provision of care is fundamental, and shortening this time is one of the best ways to reduce the risk of death and disability from cardiac arrest. Specific actions can be implemented now to decrease this time, and recent advances in science could lead to new discoveries in the causes of, and treatments for, cardiac arrest. However, specific barriers must first be addressed. Strategies to Improve Cardiac Arrest Survival examines the complete system of response to cardiac arrest in the United States and identifies opportunities within existing and new treatments, strategies, and research that promise to improve the survival and recovery of patients.

abstract = {We propose a deep convolutional neural network architecture codenamed "Inception", which was responsible for setting the new state of the art for classification and detection in the ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2014 (ILSVRC 2014). The main hallmark of this architecture is the improved utilization of the computing resources inside the network. This was achieved by a carefully crafted design that allows for increasing the depth and width of the network while keeping the computational budget constant. To optimize quality, the architectural decisions were based on the Hebbian principle and the intuition of multi-scale processing. One particular incarnation used in our submission for ILSVRC 2014 is called GoogLeNet, a 22 layers deep network, the quality of which is assessed in the context of classification and detection.},

abstract = {Premature ventricular contraction (PVC), which is a common form of cardiac arrhythmia caused by ectopic heartbeat, can lead to life-threatening cardiac conditions. Computer-aided PVC detection is of considerable importance in medical centers or outpatient ECG rooms. In this paper, we proposed a new approach that combined deep neural networks and rules inference for PVC detection. The detection performance and generalization were studied using publicly available databases: the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH-AR) and the Chinese Cardiovascular Disease Database (CCDD). The PVC detection accuracy on the MIT-BIH-AR database was 99.41{\%}, with a sensitivity and specificity of 97.59{\%} and 99.54{\%}, respectively, which were better than the results from other existing methods. To test the generalization capability, the detection performance was also evaluated on the CCDD. The effectiveness of the proposed method was confirmed by the accuracy (98.03{\%}), sensitivity (96.42{\%}) and specificity (98.06{\%}) with the dataset over 140,000 ECG recordings of the CCDD.},

abstract = {An electrocardiogram (ECG) is an important diagnostic tool for the assessment of cardiac arrhythmias in clinical routine. In this study, a deep learning framework previously trained on a general image data set is transferred to carry out automatic ECG arrhythmia diagnostics by classifying patient ECG's into corresponding cardiac conditions. Transferred deep convolutional neural network (namely AlexNet) is used as a feature extractor and the extracted features are fed into a simple back propagation neural network to carry out the final classification. Three different conditions of ECG waveform are selected from MIT-BIH arrhythmia database to evaluate the proposed framework. Main focus of this study is to implement a simple, reliable and easily applicable deep learning technique for the classification of the selected three different cardiac conditions. Obtained results demonstrated that the transferred deep learning feature extractor cascaded with a conventional back propagation neural network were able to obtain very high performance rates. Highest obtained correct recognition rate is 98.51{\%} while obtaining testing accuracy around 92{\%}. Based on these results, transferred deep learning proved to be an efficient automatic cardiac arrhythmia detection method while eliminating the burden of training a deep convolutional neural network from scratch providing an easily applicable technique.},

The resource has 3 interdependent components. PhysioBank is a large and growing archive of well-characterized digital recordings of physiological signals and related data for use by the biomedical research community. It currently includes databases of multiparameter cardiopulmonary, neural, and other biomedical signals from healthy subjects and from patients with a variety of conditions with major public health implications, including life-threatening arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, sleep apnea, neurological disorders, and aging. PhysioToolkit is a library of open-source software for physiological signal processing and analysis, the detection of physiologically significant events using both classic techniques and novel methods based on statistical physics and nonlinear dynamics, the interactive display and characterization of signals, the creation of new databases, the simulation of physiological and other signals, the quantitative evaluation and comparison of analysis methods, and the analysis of nonstationary processes. PhysioNet is an on-line forum for the dissemination and exchange of recorded biomedical signals and open-source software for analyzing them. It provides facilities for the cooperative analysis of data and the evaluation of proposed new algorithms. In addition to providing free electronic access to PhysioBank data and PhysioToolkit software via the World Wide Web (http://www.physionet.org), PhysioNet offers services and training via on-line tutorials to assist users with varying levels of expertise.},

@article{Maaten2008,
abstract = {We present a new technique called “t-SNE” that visualizes high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional map. The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large datasets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of datasets and compare itwith many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualiza- tions produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the datasets.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the viability of using the dynamic Bayesian Network framework as a tool to classify heart beats in long term ECG records. A Decision Support System composed by two layers is considered. The first layer performs the segmentation of each heartbeat available in the ECG record, whereas the second layer classifies the heartbeat as Premature Ventricular Contraction (PVC) or Other. The use of both static and dynamic Bayesian Networks is evaluated through using the records available in the MIT-BIH database, and the results show that the Dynamic one performs better, obtaining 95{\%} of sensitivity and 98{\%} of positive predictivity, showing that to consider the temporal relation among events is a good strategy to increase the certainty about present events.},

The proposed approach is able to learn from available data, and provides an intuitive graphical interpretation of the problem, which can be easily configured by a physician. This approach is evaluated for the first time in the problem of premature ventricular contraction (PVC) detection, using a representative set of records of the MIT-BIH database. The results obtained emphasize the capability of the Bayesian network to make decisions even when the information about some symptoms or events is not complete. Moreover, the good performance obtained opens many perspectives for the use of BN to deal with beat classification.},
